About us
--------

We approach developent via a test- and correct-by-construction approach.
at software should be deploy-ready at every stage of developement.

We have experience in building high assurance software using formal method techniques.
These techniques are more urgent as guardrails, as software development relies
more heavily on generative AI.


We have PhDs in Formal Methods from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
and are published at top conferences such as CAV, CSF, TACAS, and FMCAD, in
areas such as fundemental research in Mathematics, High-assurance healthcare, and blockchains.

We have worked at leading companies including AWS and Runtime Verification Inc.
Our experience includes
assuring consistency acorss millions of lines of distributed code
formally verified clinical decision systems,
Auditing and developement of fintech software and protocols.
