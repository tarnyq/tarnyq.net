About us
--------

We build high assurance software using [*formal method techniques*][fm]. These provide guarantees
of correctness and are more urgent than ever, serving as guardrails as software
development relies more heavily on generative AI.
Our approach involves *test-driven development* and takes *continuous-delivery* seriously:
software should be deploy-ready at every stage of development.

We have PhDs in formal methods from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
and are published at top conferences such as CAV, CSF, TACAS, and FMCAD, in
areas such as high-assurance healthcare, fundamental research in mathematics, and blockchain.

We have worked at leading companies including AWS and Runtime Verification Inc.
Our experience includes
assuring consistency across millions of lines of distributed code,
formally verified clinical decision systems, and
auditing and development of fintech software and protocols.
